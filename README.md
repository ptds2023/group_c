# pkgTest

Here's how this project's file are organized: 

- R: In this directory you can find all the R script files (.R) with functions that the package uses (example: graph creation based on the user's data)

- man: In this directory you can find the documentation files. Every function in our package has a description which is found here. 

- DESCRIPTION: This metadata file includes information about our package name, version, author and dependencies on other packages. 

- data: This directory is where all the user's data can be found. This is where they are stored once the user inputs them through the shiny app.
